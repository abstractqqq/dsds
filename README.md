# Welcome to the Dark Side of Data Science (DSDS)

This package is in pre-alpha stage. Please read CONTRIBUTING.md if you are a developer interested in contributing to this package. Also see disclaimer in the end.

Welcome to DSDS, a data science package that aims to be an improvement over a subset of sklearn's functionality, primarily in the following areas:

1. Providing practical feature prescreen (immediate detection and removal of useless featuers, data profiling, etc.)
2. Fast and furious feature selection (significantly faster F-score, MRMR, mutual_info_score, etc.), make "data preparation" stage fast and simple, and reduce the amount of code by providing well-established functions.
3. Cleaner pipeline construction and management (See examples below.)
4. Compatible with Polars LazyFrames (Yes! Pipelines can enjoy the benefits of query optimization too!)
5. Functional interface and fully typed functions for a better developer experience. No mixins, no multiple inheritance. No classes.
6. Even more performance for all of the above with the power of Rust!

Currently, the package is only built with local ML development in mind. I am aware that ML is moving towards more "orchestrated" environments like Kubeflow/Flyte. I have not tested or made compatbility considerations for those environments yet, although I don't think things would be drastically different. All ML pipeline related utility should be able to fit in a final container along with the model run. The orchestration should mostly be about queries and data filtering before the dsds-pipeline.

DSDS is built around your favorite: [Polars Dataframe](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)

## Usage

Practical Feature Prescreen
```python
from dsds.prescreen import (
    remove_if_exists
    , regex_removal
    , pattern_removal
    , var_removal
    , null_removal
    , unique_removal
    , constant_removal
    , date_removal
    , non_numeric_removal
    , get_unique_count
    , get_string_cols
    , suggest_normal
    , discrete_inferral
) # and a lot more!

```

Functional Pipeline Interface which supports both Eager and LazyFrames! And it can be pickled and load back and reapplied! See more in the examples on github.

```python
from dsds.prescreen import *
from dsds.transform import *

input_df = df.lazy()
output = input_df.pipe(var_removal, threshold = 0.5, target = "Clicked on Ad")\
    .pipe(binary_encode)\
    .pipe(ordinal_auto_encode, cols = ["City", "Country"])\
    .pipe(impute, cols=["Daily Internet Usage", "Daily Internet Usage Band", "Area Income Band"], strategy="median")\
    .pipe(impute, cols=["Area Income"], strategy = "mean")\
    .pipe(scale, cols=["Area Income", "Daily Internet Usage"])\
    .pipe(one_hot_encode, cols= ["One_Hot_Test"])\
    .pipe(remove_if_exists, cols = ["Ad Topic Line", "Timestamp"])\
    .pipe(mutual_info_selector, target = "Clicked on Ad", top_k = 12)
```

Performance without sacrificing user experience.

And yes, significantly faster than NumPy in many cases

## Dependencies

Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11+ is recommended.

It should run on all versions >= 3.9.

Note: scikit-learn, lightgbm, xgboost and nltk are needed for full functionalities. 


# Why the name DSDS?

I choose the name Dark Side of Data Science because data pipelines are like real life pipelines, buried under the ground. It is the most foundational work that is also the most under-appreciated component of any data science project. Feature selection is often considered a dark art, too. So the name DarkSide/dsds really makes sense to me.

# Why is this package dependent on Sklearn?

You are right in the sense that this package does its best to separate itself from sklearn because of its focus and design. You do not need sklearn for pipelines, transformations, metrics, or the prescreen modules. However, for the fs (feature selection) module, right now there is no other high quality, tried and true package for random forest and logistic regression. The feature importance from these two models are used in some feature selection algorithms. Feel free to let me know if there are alternatives.

# Why not write more in Rust?

Yes. I am. I recently resumed working on traditional NLP, and this is an area where Rust really shines. It is well-known that Stemmers in NLTK has terrible performance, but stemming is an important operations for many traditional NLP algorithms. To combat this, I have decided to move stemming and other heavy string manipulations to Rust and leave only a very thin wrapper in Python. That said, using Rust can greatly improve performance in many other modules, not just dsds.text. But because development in Rust is relatively slow, I do not want to blindly 'rewrite' in Rust. In near future, I do not have plans to 'rewrite' in Rust, if performance gain is less than 10%.

# Disclaimer

I do not claim dsds is a superior package to any other traditional machine learning libraries. In fact no one can make this claim. Each package has their own flavor, and there are things that people can disagree with. Disagreements do not translate to contempt or hatred. I primarily set out to make this project because:

1. I want to learn more about machine learning engineering
2. I want to improve my coding skill
3. I see opportunies to make things run faster using Polars without relying on bigger machines on the cloud. I want to make this happen for everybody.
4. I don't think OOP is right for scientific computing.

Everyone has their own bias. I believe in the functional style for scientific computing. I don't like the OOP style adopted by so many other packages, especially the one used in Sklearn pipelines. If you want to discuss, please kindly send me a message on discord. Please do not cherry pick points and claim that my code is **** just because you have never seen functional codebase or projects done in this style. I do not claim to have the best style of code either. OOP elements are still used in this project because it is inevitable in Python.

That said, since performance and functional design are the two major pillars of this project, I will include a lot of benchmarks and code that showcase the style differences. A lot of benchmarks will be done vs. Scikit-learn because Scikit-learn is the de facto "standard" in the tranditional machine learning space. I do this not because I want to prove dsds is superior, but because I want to show the improvement and show people that dsds achieves what it aims to achieve, an improvement over a subset of Scikit-learn's functionalities (in the areas that I set out to improve on, e.g. performance and 'style').

Every few days there is a new javascript framework. Why can't data scientists challenge the design of Scikit-learn? I started learning using Scikit-learn, like 90% of all the data scientists out there. I am free to express my opinions and criticisms. 

No package is perfect and you are free to like/hate it. Just don't be complaining online without ever thinking deeply about machine learning infra and bottlenecks in machine learning pipelines. Don't hate on things because they are different.
